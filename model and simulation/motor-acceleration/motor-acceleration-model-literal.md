Now, we face a common challenge: modeling a DC motor system when its detailed datasheet parameters (like armature resistance, inductance, torque constant $K_t$, back-EMF constant $K_b$) are unavailable. We'll aim for an empirical model based on measurable quantities.

The system is the motor-wheel pair.
* **Input:** Duty Cycle ($D$) of the PWM signal (a dimensionless value, $0 \le D \le 1$).
* **Output:** Wheel's angular acceleration relative to the motor shaft ($\ddot{\phi}$).
* **Knowns:** PWM frequency $f$, PWM supply voltage $V$, wheel moment of inertia $I_{w,cm}$ (calculated in the previous model).
    $I_{w,cm} = \frac{1}{8} M_{wheel} (D_{wheel\_out}^2 + D_{wheel\_in}^2)$
* **Measurable:** Motor shaft speed $\dot{\phi}$ (via encoder), and by extension $\ddot{\phi}$ (by numerical differentiation of $\dot{\phi}$). The robot's body angle $\theta$ and its derivatives $\dot{\theta}, \ddot{\theta}$ might also be measurable depending on other sensors.

## Theoretical Basis (Simplified DC Motor Model)

1.  **Effective Voltage:** The PWM signal provides an average voltage to the motor:
    $V_{eff} = D \cdot V$
    This assumes the PWM frequency $f$ is high enough for the motor's inductance to smooth the current.

2.  **Motor Torque:** The torque $\tau_m$ generated by a DC motor can be approximated by a linear model:
    $\tau_m \approx c_1 V_{eff} - c_2 \dot{\phi}$
    $\tau_m \approx (c_1 V) D - c_2 \dot{\phi}$
    Where:
    * $\dot{\phi}$ is the angular speed of the motor shaft relative to the motor casing.
    * $c_1$ is a constant related to motor's torque constant and armature resistance.
    * $c_2$ is a constant related to motor's torque constant, back-EMF constant, and armature resistance (it represents speed-dependent damping, primarily from back-EMF).

    Let $K_D = c_1 V$ and $K_{\omega} = c_2$. Then:
    $\tau_m \approx K_D D - K_{\omega} \dot{\phi}$
    $K_D$ represents how effectively the duty cycle generates torque (at zero speed). $K_{\omega}$ represents how much torque is lost per unit of angular speed.

3.  **Load Dynamics:** The motor torque $\tau_m$ is applied to the wheel. This torque causes the absolute angular acceleration of the wheel ($\ddot{\theta}_w = \ddot{\theta} + \ddot{\phi}$), where $\ddot{\theta}$ is the angular acceleration of the robot body (motor casing).
    From the previous derivation (Equation 2):
    $\tau_m = I_{w,cm} (\ddot{\theta} + \ddot{\phi})$

## Combining Motor Model and Load Dynamics

Equating the two expressions for $\tau_m$:
$K_D D - K_{\omega} \dot{\phi} = I_{w,cm} (\ddot{\theta} + \ddot{\phi})$

The model for the motor-wheel pair, with input $D(t)$ and output $\ddot{\phi}(t)$, is:

$$\ddot{\phi}(t) = \frac{K_D}{I_{w,cm}} D(t) - \frac{K_{\omega}}{I_{w,cm}} \dot{\phi}(t) - \ddot{\theta}(t)$$

Where:
* $D(t)$ is the PWM duty cycle (input).
* $\dot{\phi}(t)$ is the wheel's angular velocity relative to the motor shaft (a state variable, measurable).
* $\ddot{\theta}(t)$ is the angular acceleration of the robot body (a coupling term from the rest of the system). If the model is strictly for the motor-wheel pair isolated from body motion effects (e.g., for test bench characterization), this term might be considered zero. However, in the context of the self-balancing robot, it's present.
* $I_{w,cm}$ is the moment of inertia of the wheel about its axis.
* $K_D$ and $K_{\omega}$ are constants determined experimentally as described above.

**Assumptions and Notes:**
* The linear motor model $\tau_m = K_D D - K_{\omega} \dot{\phi}$ is an approximation. Real motors have nonlinearities like stiction, friction, and magnetic saturation.
* The effectiveness of $V_{eff} = D \cdot V$ depends on the PWM frequency being sufficiently high relative to the motor's electrical time constant.
* Temperature can affect motor parameters (especially winding resistance, which influences $K_D$ and $K_{\omega}$). The experiments should be done at typical operating temperatures.
* Numerical differentiation to get $\ddot{\phi}$ from $\dot{\phi}$ (which itself might be from position $\phi$) can be noisy. Filtering or careful numerical methods will be needed.

This model provides a practical way to relate PWM input to the wheel's relative acceleration, incorporating key measurable effects and known mechanical properties, while abstracting away detailed internal motor electrodynamics.
